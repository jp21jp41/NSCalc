# NSCalc (Defunct) (Not Implementable)

This project seeks to create a calculator with the capabilities of storing basic equation solutions as well as converting to the hexadecimal or binary number system. The primary goal is to simply test the limits of what methods beyond remedial calculation a calculator can do.
Of course, the project has a multitude of current limitations, such as the inability to compute equations (given the surprisingly complicated nature of switch converting) as well as the unsettled setup of buttons, display, advanced methods, etc..

Developer-edited files:
- CalculatorForm.cs
- CalculatorForm.Designer.cs
- README.md
Note that the project only has one developer, so it takes time to make improvements. That also means the limitations are bound to said one developer. Other part-time obligations, such as other projects and studies related to programming, also interfere with the ability of this project to continue properly. Notes on the project have been updated, and it will be considered a priority.

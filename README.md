# NSCalc (Defunct) (Not Implementable)

This project seeks to create a calculator with the capabilities of storing basic equation solutions as well as converting to the hexadecimal or binary number system. The primary goal is to simply test the limits of what methods beyond remedial calculation a calculator can do.
Of course, the project has a multitude of current limitations, such as the inability to compute equations (given the surprisingly complicated nature of switch converting) as well as the unsettled setup of buttons, display, advanced methods, etc..
